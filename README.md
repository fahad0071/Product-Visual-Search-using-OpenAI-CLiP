# Product-Visual-Search-using-OpenAI-CLiP

The VisualShop project aims to revolutionize the online shopping experience by introducing a cutting-edge visual search system for e-commerce. This system, powered by advanced AI and computer vision technologies, allows users to effortlessly upload images of desired products, eliminating the need for precise text information. Leveraging the multi-modal CLIP model, a variant of the Vision Transformer (VIT), and the Pinecone vector database, the system analyzes images, identifies visual features, and searches the catalog for visually similar items. The result is an enhanced product discovery process, providing users with a seamless and language-free shopping experience.

## Key Features
Visual Search Capability: Users can upload images of desired products, enabling a visual search that goes beyond traditional text-based searches.

AI-Powered Analysis: The system utilizes the multi-modal CLIP model for advanced image analysis, ensuring accurate identification of visual features.

Pinecone Vector Database Integration: Pinecone vector database is employed for efficient storage and retrieval of visual information, optimizing the search process.

Streamlit User Interface: A user-friendly interface is created using Streamlit, enhancing the overall shopping experience for users.

## Implementation Stack
AI and Computer Vision: OpenAI's CLIP model and Vision Transformer (VIT) are the backbone of the system, providing state-of-the-art image analysis capabilities.

Vector Database: Pinecone is utilized as the vector database, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval of visual information.

User Interface (UI): The project features a Streamlit-based UI, offering an intuitive and interactive platform for users to perform visual searches.
